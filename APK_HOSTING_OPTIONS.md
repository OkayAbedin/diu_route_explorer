# APK Hosting on GitHub Releases

Since Firebase Spark plan doesn't allow executable files, here are your options:

## Option 1: GitHub Releases (Recommended - FREE)

1. **Create a GitHub repository** for your app releases
2. **Upload APKs as release assets**
3. **Update download links** to point to GitHub

### Steps:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Releases" ‚Üí "Create a new release"
3. Upload your APK files as assets
4. Copy the download URLs

### Example URLs format:
```
https://github.com/yourusername/diurouteexplorer/releases/download/v1.0.0/app-release.apk
https://github.com/yourusername/diurouteexplorer/releases/download/v1.0.0/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk
```

## Option 2: Google Drive (Quick solution)

1. **Upload APKs to Google Drive**
2. **Make them publicly accessible**
3. **Get shareable links**

## Option 3: Upgrade Firebase Plan

- **Upgrade to Blaze plan** (pay-as-you-use)
- **Allows executable files**
- **Small cost for file storage/bandwidth**

## Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Download page is deployed
- ‚ùå APK files blocked by Firebase
- üéØ Need alternative hosting for APKs
